# hello-world
This is a short description of my hello-world initial GitHub project.

This is my first edit to my first branch to my first GitHub project. I'm writing a pair of sentences.

Apparently you can't put a space between the number sign and the number for the issue you are closing. I'm going to submit a pull request for this commit and entitle it "fixes #1 (for real this time)". This is way more detail to "read me" read.
